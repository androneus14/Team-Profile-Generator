# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a Team Profile Generator through the use of node.js. The task is to take information about employees on a software engineering team, and through the use of our application, generate a HTML webpage that displays a summary for each person. 

Another task we need to complete is testing to make sure the code is maintainable so we need to write a unit test for every part of the code and ensuring that it passes each test.
